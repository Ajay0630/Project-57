                <p>My favorite hobby is reading books. I like to read during my freetime after distance learning and homework. I am 10 years old and I read in 5th grade standard. Reading is a very good habit that makes me feel complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone and I devoloped it when I was 5-6. Reading books is a good source of entertainment, inspiration, and knowledge. It makes us disciplined,loyal, and punctual.It can even make you succesful in life.</p>
